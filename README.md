# Threading-practice
This is not programming. This is just me showing some practice stuff I do, and it is with the topic of Threading 
I still don't understand this topic very well, but using some tutorials online was pretty cool 

Probably will use this in the future, and then delete this repo, but for now just me showing some practice
